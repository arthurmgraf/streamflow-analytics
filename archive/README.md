# Archive

> Historical versions, deprecated artifacts, and past deliverables

---

## Purpose

This directory stores historical versions of project artifacts that are no longer active but may be needed for reference.

---

## What Goes Here

- Previous versions of major components (zipped)
- Deprecated design documents
- Historical configurations
- Past release artifacts

---

## Naming Convention

```text
{{artifact-name}}-v{{version}}.zip
{{artifact-name}}-{{date}}.tar.gz
```

---

## Guidelines

- Archive before deleting significant code or configurations
- Include a brief description in the filename or a manifest
- Consider using git tags for code versions instead of zip files
- Keep this directory lean - only archive what has reference value
